# SunnySunday

SunnySunday is a weather website using Google Maps and Openweathermap data to let people find best places to visit in their entourage; For warmer winter weather vacation or cool summer escapes. 

It is a NodeJs & Express web app with other dependencies (axios, reverse-geocode, nearby-cities, openweather-apis...)


# Deployment

Please replace Google Map API with yours, and Openweathermap API as well. Don't forget to set origins in your cloud accounts. Search for YOUR_GOOGLEMAPS_API_KEY and YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY.

Then run:

`npm install` which installs dependencies.

Please know that I am not a keen NodeJS developer, but I successfully made this weather application. It is in its early stage and not proper for final service yet.

If you contribute, please consider that I can merge and publish a new release under one channel or another. It will be 100% free although I can add ads to generate some coffee expenses :)

If you want to maintain the project with me, you can alwayse ask.

Please keep it fair if you want to deploy anywhere, ask for permission.

Sweet coding !
